## Current Issues

Totem of Neverdying (from Netherite Extras) cannot be equipped in the charm slot, despite Charm of Undying having Fabric compat with it. The regular Totem of Undying can be equipped in the charm slot and has no problems. When making 1.3.1, I attempted using the Fabric version, but it is broken on NeoForge.

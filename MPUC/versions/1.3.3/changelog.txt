# GK1H-T1.21.1NF 1.3.3 - Accessorify Update

## Mod Additions

Accessorify

## Mod Removals

Elytra Slot

Charm of Undying

## Mod Updates

YetAnotherConfigLib (YACL) (3.7.1 to 3.8.0)

## New Issues

Totem of Neverdying (from Netherite Extras) cannot be equipped in the charm slot. Accessiorify does not currently have compatibility with Netherite Extras. I have opened an issue on their GitHub to see if they can add compatibility. In the meantime, you can use the totem in your offhand or main hand.

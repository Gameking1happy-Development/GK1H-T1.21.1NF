# GK1HC&C 21.1.1.0 - Versioning & Name Change

## Changes

Renamed to GK1H Cookies & Cream.

Changed versioning to [Minecraft Minor].[Minecraft Patch].[Major].[Minor].

## Current Issues

Totem of Neverdying (from Netherite Extras) cannot be equipped in the charm slot. Accessiorify does not currently have compatibility with Netherite Extras. I have opened an issue on their GitHub to see if they can add compatibility. In the meantime, you can use the totem in your offhand or main hand.

# GK1H-T1.21.1NF 1.4.2 - More Performance Mods

## Mod Additions

Noisium

BadOptimizations

## Mod Updates

Collective (8.5 to 8.7)

Kiwi ü•ù (15.7.3 to 15.7.4)

Zoomify (2.14.4 to 2.14.6)

## Current Issues

Totem of Neverdying (from Netherite Extras) cannot be equipped in the charm slot. Accessiorify does not currently have compatibility with Netherite Extras. I have opened an issue on their GitHub to see if they can add compatibility. In the meantime, you can use the totem in your offhand or main hand.

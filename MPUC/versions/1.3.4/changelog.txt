# GK1H-T1.21.1NF 1.3.4 - Minor Update

## Changes

Mostly minor changes.

## Current Issues

Totem of Neverdying (from Netherite Extras) cannot be equipped in the charm slot. Accessiorify does not currently have compatibility with Netherite Extras. I have opened an issue on their GitHub to see if they can add compatibility. In the meantime, you can use the totem in your offhand or main hand.

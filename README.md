GK1H Vanilla+ is a Vanilla+ modpack made by Gameking1happy Development. It was created by Gameking1happy using the instance he used for vanilla, with additions including stuff to actually make it into a modpack.  

# Content  

GK1HV+ adds QOL & performance improvements, and some additional items, blocks, and mobs.  

# Uses  

It can be used for singleplayer, multiplayer, and vanilla/plugin servers. Please note that in certain cases mods might need to be disabled to play properly, usually only on vanilla/plugin servers.  

# Plans  

There will be a mod list which will also include if mod should be disabled or enabled on modpack/vanilla servers.

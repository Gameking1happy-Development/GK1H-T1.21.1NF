GK1H Vanilla+ is a Vanilla+ modpack made by Gameking1happy Development. It was created by Gameking1happy using the instance he used for vanilla, with additions including stuff to actually make it into a modpack. It then was rebuilt using NeoForge 1.21.1, and is now only for use in singleplayer or servers using the modpack.

# Client Pack  
To install the modpack with the mods, you need a launcher that can install either CurseForge or Modrinth modpacks, or can install both. While it is recommended to download and install via the launcher, you can also download manually.  
## Launchers  
[ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/downloads/) (Recommended.)  
[Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/?from=button/) (Alternative choice.)  
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/app/) (Not recommended, but preferred over CurseForge.)  
[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app/) (Not recommended.)  
# Server Pack  
To install the mods for server pack, simply copy the mods file from the client pack and paste them in the server pack. **DOWNLOAD THE SERVER PACK FROM THE LINKS, NOT VIA ANY LAUNCHER'S CREATE SERVER FEATURE, TO DO CORRECTLY!!!**  
# Modpack Links  
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/gk1h-vanilla+/) (Preferred.)  
[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gk1h-vanilla-plus/) (Not preferred.)

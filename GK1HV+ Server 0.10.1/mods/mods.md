# Client Pack  
To install the modpack with the mods, you need a launcher that can install either CurseForge or Modrinth modpacks, or can install both. While it is recommended to download and install via the launcher, you can also download manually.  
## Launchers  
[ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/downloads/) (Recommended.)  
[Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/?from=button/) (Alternative choice.)  
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/app/) (Not recommended, but preferred over CurseForge.)  
[CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app/) (Not recommended.)  
# Server Pack  
**DOWNLOAD THE SERVER PACK FROM THE LINKS, NOT VIA ANY LAUNCHER'S CREATE SERVER FEATURE, TO DO CORRECTLY!!!**  
There are two method to install the mods for server pack:  
1. Removal (Recommended)  
  1. Open **modlistremoved.md** in the server pack in an editor/viewer that has a line count.  
  2. Move or copy all mods from the client pack to the server pack.  
  3. Delete the .connector folder, and all mods that are listed.  
  4. Manually double check that you deleted all the mods listed.  
  5. Open **modlistserver.md** in the server pack.  
  6. Double check the mods, not fully manually, by making sure the mod count (in the mods folder, do not run the server to check) and line count are the same.  
2. Exclusion (Not Recommended)  
  1. Open **modlistserver.md** in the server pack in an editor/viewer that has a line count.  
  2. Move or copy all mods that are listed from the client pack to the server pack, exclude the .connector folder.  
  3. Double check the mods, not fully manually, by making sure the mod count (in the mods folder, do not run the server to check) and line count are the same.  
If you feel you incorrectly installed the mods, run the server, put the log on [mclogs](https://mclo.gs), and share on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/AwJvGzH). **DO NOT SEND THE MOD FILES!!!**
